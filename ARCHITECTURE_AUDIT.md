# ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md — Shadowfetch Linux 4.0.0

Scope: `~/projects/shadowfetch-4.0.0` (released 4.0.0 source), `~/.sfbuild/release-sources/shadowfetch-linux-site`, `web/shadowfetch-linux-worker`. Synthesised from eight domain audits (Mission Control, Fireline/Firebreak, privilege boundaries, packaging/release, desktop apps, recovery/telemetry, web/publish, testing). All severities reconciled globally; where two audits disagreed, the higher severity is carried and the reconciliation is noted in §3.

---

## 1. Executive summary

Shadowfetch Linux 4.0.0 is a KDE/Debian-testing derivative whose product thesis is *agent safety*: a coding agent runs full-auto inside a bubblewrap sandbox (**Firebreak**), against one workspace, with a pre-run Btrfs/tar **checkpoint**, and the human reviews a diff and either accepts or undoes. Around that sit **Mission Control** (a queue + CLI + Qt page that runs Codex missions), **Phoenix** (root-subvolume rollback), **Fireproof** (simulate-first updates via a root D-Bus daemon), **Firewatch** (root telemetry daemon), **Control Center** and **Welcome** (PyQt6), and a signed APT repo + ISO published to R2 behind two Cloudflare Workers.

The engineering is uneven in a specific and diagnosable way: the *narrow* pieces are excellent (hwscan's fixture suite, `sf_mission_account.py`'s credential validation, `publish_release_4_0_0.py`'s all-or-nothing plan with immutable-object refusal, `build_apt_repo.py`'s dual-implementation signature verification, Firebreak's environment scrub), while every *seam* between components is an undocumented convention — a prose string scraped by regex, an argv shape asserted in one place out of three, an environment variable that silently relocates a security boundary.

The five things that matter most:

1. **Firebreak is a filesystem boundary and nothing else.** `--net allow` does not create a network namespace at all (`shadowfetch-firebreak:112-113`), and Mission Control makes `--net allow` *mandatory* for every code and report mission (`sf_missions.py:285-286`). So the normal configuration shares the host's network namespace — full egress, every loopback service, and the host's abstract AF_UNIX socket namespace (verified live: `@/tmp/.X11-unix/X0`, ollama:11434, sshd:22). There is no seccomp filter, no capability policy, no uid remap, and the agent runs as the human's own uid. Worse, the one credential Firebreak hands the agent — the Codex `auth.json` — is bind-mounted **read-write** into the sandbox (`shadowfetch-firebreak:133`) alongside guaranteed egress.
2. **There is no provider abstraction, and the release gate forbids creating one.** "Provider" is the string `config["runtime"]` with two legal values, welded 1:1 to mission `kind`, re-validated in five places, and dispatched by `getattr(self, kind)()` (`sf_missions.py:706`). `tools/mission_provider_contract.py:25` asserts `set(runtimes) == {"codex","offline"}` by AST-parsing the source, and is enforced by the source gate, the package gate *and* the ISO gate. Adding Claude Code, Grok, Cursor or a local model is a build failure by construction — and the AST approach also forbids the refactor itself.
3. **The release process was routed around, and the tooling that would have stopped it cannot run.** `.git` in the 4.0.0 tree points at a deleted parent worktree, so `git ls-files`, `git diff --check` and the `gitleaks git` history scan all fail — `make source-gate` is unrunnable in the tree that produced the shipped ISO. `qa/4.0.0/acceptance.json` has 13 of 18 required cases at `pending` with no evidence and a null bundle hash, yet the ISO is live; `publish_release_4_0_0.py` refuses that manifest today. R2 holds a 4.0.0 ISO next to a **3.5.0-1** APT tree, and the live `InRelease` expires **2026-09-20**, twelve days out, with no refresh path that does not require a full rebuild the acceptance gate would reject.
4. **Nothing agentic is observable, auditable or blockable.** Agent tool calls are never parsed (`sf_missions.py:502-516` keeps only `turn.completed` and the last `agent_message`); `approval_policy="never"` is hard-coded; the four MCP servers — including `checkpoint.undo`, which rmtree's a workspace — write zero log lines; Firebreak's session record omits the agent command entirely and is overwritten in place; and the human review diff is blind to `.git`, symlink swaps and mode changes and is forgeable by a newline in a filename. There is no correlation id joining a mission to a sandbox session to a checkpoint.
5. **Duplication is the dominant maintenance cost and the direct cause of shipped defects.** Six near-identical copies of every gate script (~14,500 lines in `tools/`, of which ~2,700 are live and untested — the unit tests target the 2.1.4/2.1.5 copies); five copies of the Umbra palette; three copies of the workspace-name rule; two complete divergent system updaters; three implementations of "current release". Two shipped 4.0.0 buttons are dead because the correct argv existed in two places and the third copy was written from a docstring: Control Center bundle installs omit the helper verb, and every timed Ember option passes a flag the root helper rejects — both after the user has entered an admin password.

## 3. Major problems

**Severity reconciliations.** Where audits disagreed: the `--net allow` no-namespace finding is **P0** (fireline P0 over privilege P1) because Mission Control makes it mandatory; the read-write credential bind is **P0** (missions P0 over fireline P1) for the same reason; the unscoped `fs` MCP server is **P0** (fireline P0 over privilege P1) because the shipped `shadowfetch-mcp config` output creates it; the broken git worktree is **P0** (packaging/testing/missions P0 over recovery P3) because it disables the secret-scan gate for a released tree. Duplicate IDs are merged and cross-referenced below.

### 3.1 Firebreak is not a security boundary in the shipped configuration — P0

- **No network namespace on the mandatory path.** `shadowfetch-firebreak:112-113` adds `--unshare-net` only when `net == "none"`; `:94` derives the default from the cosmetic fire/ice theme (`element()`, `:40-47`), and `sf_missions.py:285-286` refuses any code/report mission that is not `network="allow"`. Verified live: host abstract sockets (`@/tmp/.X11-unix/X0`, `@cuda-uvmfd-*`) and loopback services (ollama 11434, sshd 22/2222, NFS 2049, SMB 445) are reachable from inside. *(SEC-NET-01 / SEC-FB-01)*
- **The credential is inside the sandbox, writable.** `shadowfetch-firebreak:133` uses `--bind` (not `--ro-bind`) for the Codex account dir and `:134` sets `CODEX_HOME`; `:116-117` *requires* `net == "allow"` for that grant. Report missions concatenate untrusted documents into the prompt (`sf_missions.py:589`) and run with `approval_policy="never"`. *(MISS-SEC-01 / SEC-CRED-02)*
- **No second layer.** No `--seccomp`, no `--cap-drop`, no uid remap, nested userns permitted, `/usr` bound read-only in full including every setuid binary; the agent runs as the human's uid. *(SEC-BOUND-01)*
- **Report missions get a writable workspace at the OS layer**; read-only is a flag interpreted by the contained process (`sf_missions.py:490` vs `firebreak:111`). *(MISS-SEC-03)*
- **Validation runs with full egress** because `run_process` reuses the mission-level `--net` for the test command too (`sf_missions.py:419` used at `:628`). *(MISS-SEC-07)*
- **Persistence escapes containment.** Agent-written `.git/hooks`, `.git/config` exec keys, `.envrc`, `package.json` scripts and `node_modules/.bin` shims execute on the host the next time the human opens the project; neither the diff nor undo treats them specially. *(SEC-PERSIST-01)*

**Impact:** for the product's primary use case the practical boundary is "one writable directory", with the user's ChatGPT refresh token inside it and unrestricted egress out of it.

### 3.2 The first-party MCP `fs` server is a home-directory read oracle — P0

`sf_mcp.py:468` defaults `SF_MCP_FS_ROOT` to `Path.cwd()`, and the config the product tells users to generate (`shadowfetch-mcp config --json|--claude`, `FIRELINE.md:18-19`) sets no `env` block. Verified live: launched from `$HOME` it advertises itself as "scoped to $HOME" and returns `.ssh/` contents. Every test pins the variable, so the shipped default is never exercised. `debian/control` describes it as "scoped read-only file access". *(SEC-MCP-01)*

### 3.3 Passwordless and unauthenticated root paths — P0/P1

- `org.shadowfetch.fireline.check` sets `allow_active=yes` and annotates `exec.path=/usr/bin/shadowfetch-firebreak` — pkexec passes the caller's whole argv, and that binary's `run` subcommand ends in `subprocess.Popen(cmd)` with `nargs=REMAINDER` (`:147`, `:210`). It has no caller anywhere in the tree. What blocks exploitation today is undocumented and accidental: pkexec resets `HOME`, so the workspace root becomes `/root/Workspaces`. *(SEC-PKX-01, P0)*
- `fireproofd.Verify()` (`:1120-1129`) has no `sender_keyword` and no `_require_auth`, and its needrestart block does `systemctl restart <svc>` as root (`:635-653`); the bus policy allows any local uid on any interface (`Fireproof1.conf:16-19`). `Analyze()` (`:844-856`) is likewise unauthenticated and spawns an unbounded thread building a full `apt.Cache()` per call. *(SEC-FP-01 P0, SEC-FP-02 P1)*
- `phoenix-recovery-report` takes `$1` as an unvalidated output path and does `mkdir -p`/`tar -czf`/`chmod`/`chown $PKEXEC_UID` as root, under `auth_admin_keep` — one legitimate diagnostics export converts into a session-long arbitrary-root-write capability. It has no in-tree caller. *(SEC-PKX-02, P1)*
- Four privileged operations run through pkexec with **no registered action**, including `pkexec /bin/sh -c` (`busutil.py:511`) whose two named-helper alternatives do not exist in the tree. *(SEC-PKX-03, P2)*

### 3.4 Privileged GUI actions are PATH-hijackable — P0

`busutil.terminal_command` (`:659-670`) wraps a command string in `konsole -e bash -lc`, and `/etc/skel/.profile` prepends `$HOME/bin` and `$HOME/.local/bin` to PATH. Callers pass bare names: `shadowfetch-gpu`, `shadowfetch-recovery`, `shadowfetch-health`, `shadowfetch-update`, `shadowfetch-agent-workspace`. Every pkexec invocation names `"pkexec"` relatively; so do `systemctl` and `shadowfetch-missions`. Two lines in `~/.bashrc` — the file an escaped agent writes first — own the buttons whose real tools then ask for a root password. `shadowfetch-gpu:383` compounds this by re-execing `$0` under pkexec with no polkit action of its own. *(SEC-PATH-01 P0, SEC-GPU-01 P1)*

### 3.5 Mission Control cannot express the target architecture — P0/P1

- `tools/mission_provider_contract.py:25` freezes runtimes to `{codex, offline}` and is enforced by `source_gate_4_0_0.py:217`, `package_gate_4_0_0.py:239`, `iso_gate_4_0_0.py:774`. It reaches its data by AST-parsing `capabilities()` for a literal `return {...}` — so a registry-driven `capabilities()` makes the gate raise `ValueError`, and a rename makes a bare `next()` raise `StopIteration` rather than a policy failure. *(MISS-GATE-01, P0)*
- Provider identity is five scattered literals plus `getattr(self, kind)()` (`sf_missions.py:274, 275, 283-286, 476, 691, 706, 798, 845`), repeated in the UI (`missions_page.py:139, 166`). "Run this same mission with Claude instead" is not expressible in the schema. Grok Bot is a second launcher page with no engine integration at all. *(MISS-ARCH-01, ARCH-MISSION-01, P1)*
- No state machine: `Store.update` allow-lists *columns*, not values; `ACTIVE`/`FINAL` are declared and `FINAL` is unused; transitions are enforced ad hoc at five call sites. *(MISS-ARCH-02, P2)*

### 3.6 Nothing an agent does is observable, auditable or blockable — P1

- Only `turn.completed` and the final `agent_message` are parsed (`sf_missions.py:502-516`); `approval_policy="never"` (`:490`). No ToolExecution record, no Approval object, no mid-run block. *(MISS-OBS-01)*
- The review diff prunes `.git` and `node_modules` (`sf_missions.py:40`, `tree_index:116`), is blind to symlink swaps and mode changes, truncates silently at 500 entries, and is forgeable by a newline in a filename (all demonstrated live). Undo's `recovery_index` walks everything, so the user is simultaneously told "no changes" and "cannot undo". *(MISS-OBS-02, SEC-DIFF-01)*
- The four MCP servers write zero audit records, including `checkpoint.undo`. *(AUDIT-MCP-01)*
- Firebreak's session manifest omits `agent_command` entirely and is **overwritten** at exit; there is no correlation id joining mission ↔ session ↔ checkpoint ↔ tool call. Evidence is split across four uncorrelated, uid-writable stores. `debian/control` claims journald audit; nothing writes to journald. *(AUDIT-CORR-01, MISS-AUD-01, SEC-AUDIT-01, AUDIT-TAMPER-01)*
- Consent lives only in the Qt dialog; the engine will queue and run a network-enabled cloud mission for any local process (`sf_missions.py:272-306`, `:879-880`). *(MISS-SEC-04)*

### 3.7 Recovery can silently stop working, and restore is not crash-atomic — P0

- Two unordered first-boot units race to create the snapper root config with opposite policies (`firstboot.sh:56-73` `TIMELINE_CREATE=yes/NUMBER_LIMIT=12/ALLOW_USERS` vs `phoenix-firstboot:61-105` `no/8/ALLOW_GROUPS` plus the mandatory `@snapshots` dance). Losing the race nests `.snapshots` inside `@`, so `phoenix-restore:122` fails for every point — and a restore that did run would `mv --exchange` away the entire snapshot history. Fireproof keeps advertising rollback because `phoenix_available()` (`fireproofd:227-244`) checks only fstype + config existence. *(REC-PHX-01 P0, CONTRACT-FP-01 P1)*
- `phoenix-restore` mutates `/boot` (moves kernels, `update-grub`) **before** the atomic exchange, and the `EXIT INT TERM` trap only syncs and unmounts — `rollback_external_boot` is called from two explicit failure paths and never from the trap. An interrupt in that window leaves grub.cfg pointing at deleted kernels. *(REC-PHX-02, P0)*
- Leftovers are never fully reclaimed: the newest `@_prev_*` is kept forever despite the user being told cleanup is automatic, and `/boot/phoenix-kernel-backup-*` is never cleaned by anything. *(PHX-04, P2)*
- `shadowfetch-recovery` — the tool the updater tells users to run when an update fails — is a 35-line stale menu that mentions none of the Phoenix tools. *(RECOVERY-MENU-01, P2)*

### 3.8 The release pipeline was bypassed and cannot currently run — P0

- **Broken worktree.** `.git` → deleted `~/projects/shadowfetch-3.5.0/.git/worktrees/...`. `source_gate_4_0_0.py:88-94` dies on `git ls-files`; the gitleaks history scan (`:176-212`) and `git diff --check` (`:363`) never run; `pre_release_check.sh:38` *skips* its credential-state check and still prints `PRE_RELEASE_CHECK_PASSED`. *(REL-GATE-GIT-01 / GATE-GIT-01 / MISS-REL-01 / OPS-WORKTREE-18, P0)*
- **Acceptance bypassed.** 13 of 18 required cases `pending`, `evidence_bundle_sha256` null; `verify_acceptance_4_0_0.py verify` fails today; `make acceptance-audit` runs with `--allow-pending` and passes anyway. Evidence is self-asserted with no binding to the artifact, no signature, and a 0-byte file hashes fine. *(TEST-REL-01, ACC-INTEGRITY-01, P0/P1)*
- **Publication mismatch.** The 4.0.0 ISO is live but all eight evidence artifacts 404, and `apt/dists/umbra` still lists `3.5.0-1` while a complete signed 4.0.0-1 repo sits unpublished in `repo/`. `publish_release_4_0_0.py` cannot even build a plan (evidence files absent). *(REL-PUBLISH-01, P0)*
- **Dated outage.** Live `InRelease` `Valid-Until: 2026-09-20`; the local replacement expires the same day; the site's own `release:verify` freshness gate (7-day minimum) blocks *all* site deploys from **2026-09-13**. *(OPS-APT-EXPIRY-01 / REL-APT-EXPIRY-02, P0)*
- **Destructive publish tooling.** `r2_prune_release.py:104-112` never validates that the kept version exists — `--version 4.0` deletes every ISO, checksum and signature under `releases/`; and its keep-set deletes exactly the retired `.sha256`/`.asc` sidecars the worker's 410 pages link and the README promises to keep. `r2_s3_publish.py` stamps every object `release=1.9.0`, overwrites without a guard, and verifies only byte count. *(SEC-R2-PRUNE-01 / SEC-PRUNE-03 P0, SEC-PRUNE-04 P1, REL-S3PUB-15 P2)*
- **APT trust.** The ISO installs first-party packages with `[trusted=yes]` (signature checking off) and ships the release key into `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` — globally trusted for *every* repository — twice, under two names. *(BUILD-TRUSTED-YES-01, SEC-APTKEY-TRUST-01, P1)*

### 3.9 Two shipped desktop actions are dead — P0/P1

`software_page.py:113` builds `["pkexec", BUNDLE_INSTALL, bundle_id]` with no verb, so all 7 Bundles Install buttons exit 2 *after* the admin password prompt (the correct form is used at `workbench_page.py:202` and `welcome:961`). `ember_page.py:355` passes `--duration <n>`, which `ember-duration:72-91` rejects; `_helper_done` then reports "Authorisation was cancelled" — blaming the user for a grant they gave — and all three timed Ember options never start. The one gate that checks this argv pattern (`package_gate_4_0_0.py:331`) looks at a single call site one file away. *(UI-ARGV-01 P0, UI-ARGV-02 P1, TEST-GAP-01 P2)*

### 3.10 Packaging and metapackage do not describe the product — P1

`shadowfetch-desktop` depends on none of phoenix, fireproof, firewatchd, hwscan, control-center or ember — they reach the image only via a live-build package list. `shadowfetch-fireproof` writes `fireproof_page.py` into `shadowfetch-control-center`'s Python package with no declared relationship in either direction, and the importing `except Exception` cannot catch the `SystemExit` that module can raise. `shadowfetch-fireline` imports `sf_mission_account` from the missions package while declaring no dependency on it — the security boundary depends on the thing it contains. Two packages set `APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade` to opposite values; `85fireproof` wins, so a testing-tracking desktop gets no automatic security updates while `52shadowfetch-unattended.conf` documents the opposite. *(PKG-01, ARCH-PLUGIN-01, MISS-PKG-01, CONF-APT-01)*

No setuid/setgid or world-writable files exist anywhere in `packages/`, `live-build/config/` or `tools/`; temp-file discipline is uniformly `mktemp`/`tempfile`. No live credentials are committed; R2 secrets are derived in memory and never written. Those are genuine strengths.

### 4.2 Is Firebreak a real boundary?

**Filesystem: yes, and well built.** `--unshare-user/-pid/-uts/-ipc`, `--new-session` (blocks `TIOCSTI`), `--clearenv` plus an explicit setenv allowlist, a `--dir /etc` with a 14-entry allowlist, private `/home/agent`, `--tmpfs /tmp,/run`, one rw workspace bind, and a `systemd-run --user --scope` carrying `TasksMax`/`MemoryMax`/`CPUQuota`. Verified absent from the argv: `/sys`, session and system D-Bus sockets, container sockets, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.config`, `~/.gnupg`, `/etc/shadow`, `/dev/dri`, `/dev/nvidia*`.

**Everything else: no.**

| Dimension | Status |
|---|---|
| Network | **Not isolated** on the mandatory path — no netns, so host loopback *and* the abstract AF_UNIX namespace are shared. No egress policy, no proxy, no destination record. |
| Credentials | Codex `auth.json` bind-mounted **read-write** at a known path, with egress guaranteed by the same code path. |
| Syscalls | No seccomp. No `--cap-drop`. Nested userns available. |
| Identity | Runs as the human's own uid — an escape is immediate full-account compromise. |
| Workspace mode | Always read-write, even for "read-only" report missions. |
| In-workspace secrets | `is_private()` blocks `.env`/`.ssh`/keys as *inputs* while the whole workspace, including them, is bound in. UI copy says "No access to other personal folders". |
| Persistence | Agent-written git hooks / `.envrc` / build scripts execute on the host afterwards; unreviewed. |
| Enforcement of the binary | Resolved through `PATH` from a user-writable `EnvironmentFile`. |
| Audit | One overwrite-in-place 0600 JSON file per session, without the command; nothing to journald. |
| Test coverage | The only test that starts bwrap is run by no automation; the argv suite contains two tautological assertions that cannot fail. |

**Verdict:** Firebreak today contains *accidental* filesystem damage. It does not contain a hostile or prompt-injected agent, and it is cosmetic for the single most valuable secret on the machine. Making it real requires four changes — unconditional netns + brokered egress, credential broker instead of a bind, seccomp + Landlock + subuid, and step-scoped sandbox specs — plus wiring `test_firebreak.sh` into the build so regressions are caught (it already contains the assertion for the RLIMIT_AS defect that cost an ISO respin).

## 5. Technical debt

**Duplication (the dominant cost).**
- 29 version-suffixed gate scripts, 14,461 lines, ~81% frozen duplicates; `verify_acceptance_4_0_0.py` is a 3-line diff from the 2.1.4 copy, and 26 of the 106 `tools/tests` cases are byte-identical pairs targeting the *old* copies while the live 4.0.0 gate logic (`critical_payload_parity_gate`, `drkonqi_gate`, the diverged `payload_gate`/`main`) has no test.
- Five copies of the Umbra palette (`sfcc/theme.py`, `shadowfetch-welcome`, `shadowfetch-fireproof`, `guide_page.py`'s exported HTML, `ShadowfetchDark.colors`), plus ten unnamed stray hexes; the fireproof page is mounted *inside* the Control Center with a different red.
- Two complete updaters (`shadowfetch-update` 342 lines of bash + sudo vs `fireproofd` 1,227 lines of D-Bus + polkit) with two rollback vocabularies, two `snapper_first_pre_after` implementations and four copies of `package_lock_busy`.
- Three implementations of "the current release" (manifest date+numeric semver, R2 upload order, and a test with a *string* tiebreak that diverges from 4.10.0 onward).
- Three implementations of the workspace-name rule (`firebreak:52`, `sf_mcp:147`, `mission_client.py:20-32`) that already disagree on leading-dot names.
- Two `@_prev` GC loops, verbatim but with different mount/trap handling.
- Three implementations of bundle install, hwscan freshness, catalog load and NM connectivity across `sfcc` and `welcome`.

**Dead code.** ~1,100 lines of unreachable HTML in the artifact worker, including a changelog frozen at 1.9.0 and "local AI built in" copy that 4.0 defers; `input_text`'s auto-discovery branch (`sf_missions.py:521-535`) has no caller; `FINAL` is declared and unused; `_vram_total` is never assigned so firewatchd's documented three-term heat score is dead; `weekly_release.sh` is a gate-bypassing auto-publish script pointing at a nonexistent tree and eradicated Hermes credentials; `packages.manifest` is 2.1.1-era and read by nothing; four orphaned OG cards; the Ice look-and-feel's own splash can never render.

**Fragility.** The recovery guarantee rides on a regex over a prose sentence, scraped by two independent parsers (`sf_missions.py:701`, `firebreak:193-196`) from an f-string meant for a language model. `latestRelease()` truncates an R2 listing at 100 objects twenty lines from a correct cursor loop. The 1 Hz worker takes the exclusive lock and JSON-decodes the whole mission table twice a second for every desktop user forever — which is *why* `REVIEW_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS` exists. `LIMIT 1000` in `Store.list` turns undo into an uncaught `StopIteration` and silently disables the single-pending-review invariant. Every checkpoint tars the whole workspace (the btrfs fast path needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and never fires unprivileged) with no retention, no quota and no free-space check — and Firebreak refuses to run if the snapshot fails, so a full disk is a hard denial of the safety feature. Restore leaks a subvolume and a `/boot` kernel set per run.

**Error handling.** Unguarded `subprocess`/`write_text` inside Qt slots abort the Control Center; the recovery-report export blocks the GUI thread for up to ~90 s on an already-broken machine; the mission worker's SIGTERM handler does SQLite writes from signal context against a 30 s busy timeout under a 15 s `TimeoutStopSec`; `undo()` rmtree's the live workspace before restoring, non-atomically, with no free-space check; `firstboot.sh` runs 15 mutations with every status discarded and then unconditionally stamps done.

**Undocumented contracts** (full list in the per-domain audits): Codex CLI argv + JSONL event vocabulary; the `auth.json` layout; the checkpoint receipt sentence; Firebreak's CLI as an ABI; `capabilities()`'s required source *shape*; six security-relevant environment variables with no schema (`SHADOWFETCH_AGENT_WORKSPACES`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `SHADOWFETCH_CHECKPOINT_BIN`, `SF_MCP_FS_ROOT`, `SHADOWFETCH_ELEMENT`, `SHADOWFETCH_MISSIONS_COMMAND`); the SF-* line protocol; `/run/phoenix-overlay` as sourced shell; btrfs top-level names as an API; `VERSION_TOKEN` → gate filename; the signing fingerprint hardcoded in five files; R2 key layout and mutability classes.

**Testing.** 359 unittest cases over ~13,000 LOC of first-party runtime code, no coverage measurement anywhere. Zero automated tests for Phoenix (~1,000 lines incl. the root-subvolume swap), Ember (~1,000 lines incl. a passwordless pkexec helper), Welcome (3,159 lines) and its 636-line root installer. CI runs `make test` + a hand-rolled subset of the source gate; it runs no gate and no acceptance. The site tree — where `deploy` → `release:verify` → `test` makes shipping without tests impossible — is the discipline the distro build lacks.

## 6. Proposed architecture

### 6.1 Shape

Mission Control stops being "a queue that knows how to run Codex" and becomes **an orchestration layer over a provider registry, with a privileged-broker boundary underneath it**. Four structural moves:

1. **`AgentProvider` registry.** Providers become packaged plugins declaring a manifest (id, capabilities, credential ids, sandbox profile, network requirement, invocation module). The engine resolves `(capability, provider)` from a registry instead of `getattr(self, kind)`. `kind` (what the human wants: `CodeChange`, `SourcedReport`, `MediaExport`) separates from `provider` (who does it), so "run this mission with Claude instead" becomes a column value.
2. **Broker on the boundary.** A host-side `shadowfetch-brokerd` (user scope) owns credentials, checkpoints, policy evaluation and the audit chain. Firebreak binds **one unix socket** into the sandbox instead of a token. Every agent action that leaves the workspace — an API call, a checkpoint, a network destination, a privileged operation — is a brokered request that is recorded as a `ToolExecution`, evaluated against policy, and either auto-approved inside a declared boundary or escalated to a desktop prompt.
3. **Firebreak becomes a provider-neutral, step-scoped primitive.** It gains `--workspace-mode {rw,ro}`, `--mask <relpath>`, `--bind-credential-dir SRC:DST[:ro]`, `--session-id`, `--seccomp`, unconditional `--unshare-net` with brokered egress, Landlock, and a subuid remap; it *loses* `--codex-account` and its import of `sf_mission_account`. Sandbox specs are per **step**, not per mission (inference: net allowlist; validation: net none; media: net none).
4. **One event/audit spine.** A single append-only, hash-chained `events` table is the system of record, mirrored to journald so the chain head leaves the user's trust domain. The desktop subscribes to a stream instead of polling; Firewatch and the Control Center read the same events.

### 6.2 Where each provider plugs in

| Provider | Transport | Credential | Sandbox profile | Events |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | `codex exec --json -` (stdin prompt, JSONL out) | brokered OpenAI/ChatGPT session | rw workspace, net allowlist `api.openai.com` | JSONL → normalised `Event` |
| Claude Code | `claude -p --output-format stream-json` | brokered Anthropic key/session | rw workspace, net allowlist `api.anthropic.com` | stream-json → `Event` |
| Grok | CLI/HTTP adapter | brokered `XAI_API_KEY` | rw workspace, allowlist `api.x.ai` | adapter-normalised |
| Cursor | headless CLI | brokered token | rw workspace, allowlist | adapter-normalised |
| Local model | localhost socket **bound in explicitly** by the broker | none | rw workspace, **net none** | adapter-normalised |
| Offline media | `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` | none | rw workspace, net none | synthetic step events |

Every provider passes the same conformance suite (fixture stream in → normalised events out, no network) before it can be registered. Grok Bot — today a launcher page with its own auth and no sandbox — is the first onboarding target precisely because it proves the interface is real.

### 6.3 Human-in-the-loop flow

1. The user (or an automated caller with a pre-granted, scoped, expiring `Approval`) creates a `Mission` naming a capability, a workspace and a boundary.
2. `run` refuses without a valid `Approval`; the GUI is one client of the approval mechanism, minted through polkit, not its sole location.
3. The engine takes a checkpoint, resolves a provider, and starts an `AgentSession` inside Firebreak with a step-scoped `SandboxSpec`.
4. Every tool call streams through the broker → `ToolExecution` row → policy verdict (`auto_allow` inside the declared boundary, `escalate` otherwise, `deny` for the never-list) → desktop prompt with a live "Stop" affordance.
5. On completion the engine emits a `Review` with the diff, a **structural `GitChange` summary that cannot be omitted**, the test result computed against a pristine overlay, the credential identities actually granted, the read grants, and the egress log.
6. Accept or Undo; Undo is transactional (`renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`) with a free-space precheck.

## 7. Data model recommendations

**Storage choice.** Keep **SQLite (WAL)** in controller state (`~/.local/state/shadowfetch/missions/missions.sqlite3`, dir `0700`, file `0600`) as the operational store: it is already there, it is transactional, it survives crashes, and it needs no daemon. Add two things it lacks: (a) a **schema-version table and real migrations** (today it is `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` only), and (b) a **journald mirror of the `events` chain head** so tamper evidence leaves the user's uid — SQLite cannot provide that on its own, and a root-owned append-only journal is the cheapest external high-water mark available on this platform. Do **not** move to a daemon-backed DB; the failure modes (availability, another root service) are worse than the problem.

**Permissions.** State dir `0700`, DB `0600`, per-mission dirs `0700`, receipts `0600`. `Store.__init__` must keep refusing a state root inside the workspace root. Broker-written rows (`tool_executions`, `events`) are written only by `shadowfetch-brokerd`; the CLI has read-only access to them via a view. Nothing in the schema is readable from inside a sandbox.

Relationships: `Mission 1—N Task 1—N AgentSession 1—N ToolExecution`; `Mission 1—1 Review`, `1—N Artifact`, `1—N TestRun`, `1—0..1 GitChange`; `Approval` is referenced by both `Mission` (the run grant) and `ToolExecution` (the per-action escalation); `Event` references all of them and is the only append-only table.

## 10. Testing strategy

**Layer 1 — unit (fast, no privilege).** Every root helper's decision logic extracted into importable functions and fixture-tested: Phoenix snapshot selection and refusal predicates against fixture `snapper list`; `ember-duration` argument validation; `bundle-install` id/verb validation; `fireproofd`'s commit arc using the existing `stubs.py` pattern; `firewatchd`'s payload builders and subscriber lifecycle; `hwscan`'s two-GPU bus-id mapping. Target: no root script ships with zero tests.

**Layer 2 — contract (the load-bearing layer for the target architecture).**
- **`AgentProvider` conformance suite:** one parametrised class every registered provider must pass against a fake transport — declared capabilities honoured; no execution without an explicit network grant; only named credentials reach the process; `Cancelled` honoured within the timeout; provenance recorded; `stream_events` normalises a captured fixture stream into the expected `AgentEvent` sequence with no network.
- **Privileged-argv contract:** enumerate every argv literal in `sfcc/*.py` and `shadowfetch-welcome` whose first element is `pkexec` and check it against each helper's declared grammar (`--contract --json`). This alone catches both shipped P0/P1 desktop defects.
- **Ship-list contract:** for each package, expand `.install` globs against the payload tree and assert the built `.deb` contains exactly that set at exactly those paths, failing in both directions with an explicit exceptions file.
- **Cross-package UI contract:** every key the Control Center reads from `capabilities()` must exist in its output.
- **Manifest/schema contracts:** JSON Schema for `providers.json`, the acceptance manifest, `releases/*.json` and the mission receipt.

**Layer 3 — integration (Firebreak actually starts).** Wire `test_firebreak.sh` into `make test` and extend it: device visibility, `/etc` allowlist equality, cgroup limits actually applied, abstract-socket connect **fails**, credential dir is `--ro-bind`, `--net allow` default asserted rather than overridden. Drive `sf_mcp` over real JSON-RPC asserting one audit row per tool call and that a denied policy produces no filesystem change. Run at least one Mission Control end-to-end test with `sandbox=True` — today every mission test sets `sandbox=False`, so Firebreak is never in the loop. Replace the two tautological assertions in `test_firebreak_4.py:48-49` with parsed bind-triple checks.

**Layer 4 — VM acceptance (automated, self-recording).** `make vm-acceptance` drives `tools/qa/vm_harness.sh` and, on success, calls `verify_acceptance record` with the produced evidence, so running the suite and recording the result are one action. First three to automate: `INSTALL-01` (headless Calamares install + boot from disk), `UPGRADE-01`, `RECOVERY-01` (snapshot → mutate root → restore → reboot → assert), plus a power-cut negative case (SIGKILL during `phoenix-restore`).

**Layer 5 — release gates.** CI runs `make source-gate` (replacing its hand-rolled syntax subset) and `make package-gate`. Coverage is measured (`python3 -m coverage` around the unittest invocations) and published as a CI artifact — the work cannot be prioritised without a number.

**Invariant:** no test that exists in the tree may be unreachable from `make test` or `make vm-acceptance`; and no evidence, no publish.

---

## 11. Migration strategy

The shipped product must keep working for installed users throughout. Five rules:

1. **Stabilise before refactoring.** Fix the dated outage (APT re-sign + publish), repair version control, and land the six one-to-ten-line security/correctness fixes first. None of them changes an interface, so they can ship as 4.0.1 with the existing gates.
2. **Preserve every external contract.** polkit `exec.path` values, D-Bus names and member signatures, the `shadowfetch-missions --json` verb set, the `SF-*` line protocol, `receipt.json` schema 1, `hwscan.json` schema 1 and the R2 key layout do not change during the refactor. Where a contract must grow, add fields; never repurpose one.
3. **Refactor behind the existing surface.** `sf_providers.py` lands with `CodexCliProvider` and `OfflineMediaProvider` moved verbatim from `Executor.codex` and `Executor.media`; `capabilities()` renders the registry and returns the *same* keys plus new ones; `getattr(self, kind)` becomes a registry lookup. The CLI, the UI and the receipt see no difference — which is exactly how the conformance suite proves the seam is behaviour-preserving.
4. **Migrate data forward, never sideways.** Add `schema_version` and write real migrations: new columns default to values that reproduce today's behaviour (`capability` derived from `kind`, `provider_id` derived from `runtime`, `events.prev_hash` seeded at the migration point with a genesis row recording that everything before it is unchained). Old missions remain listable and undoable.
5. **Sequence the boundary change so nothing is briefly less safe.** Firebreak gains `--workspace-mode`, `--mask`, `--session-id`, `--bind-credential-dir` and `--seccomp` *before* `--codex-account` is removed; the broker ships and is exercised in parallel with the direct credential path *before* the bind is deleted; `--unshare-net` becomes unconditional only once the brokered egress path passes the conformance suite, with `allowlist` as the default and `allow` retained behind an explicit, recorded per-mission Approval for one release.

Gate compatibility: `tools/providers/validate_manifest.py` replaces the AST freeze in the same commit that adds the registry, keeping `REMOVED_AI_PATH` (the payload blacklist is the good half) so the local-AI deferral stays provable. The per-version gate collapse happens once, between releases, with the old scripts moved to `tools/archive/` if reproducing an old image is a real requirement.

## 13. Phased implementation plan

### Phase 1 — Stabilise (2–3 weeks; ships as 4.0.1)

**Goals.** Stop the dated outage, restore the ability to gate a release, close the free security wins, and fix the two dead shipped buttons. No interface changes.

**Deliverables.** W-01 … W-21. Concretely: a re-signed and published 4.0.0-1 APT repo with a long `Valid-Until` and a `make refresh-index` path; a working git repository tagged `v4.0.0-as-shipped`; gates that fail loudly rather than silently; the fireline polkit action deleted; the `fs` MCP server refusing to start unscoped; `fireproofd.Verify` authorised; `r2_prune_release.py` guarded; both desktop argv fixes plus the privileged-argv contract test; absolute paths and a non-login shell for every privileged launch; the snapper first-boot race removed and `phoenix-check-layout` added; `phoenix-restore`'s trap covering `/boot`; `test_firebreak.sh` in `make test`; the 4.0.0 acceptance manifest resolved to pass or waived with a recorded evidence bundle.

**Exit criteria.** `make source-gate`, `make package-gate` and `acceptance-gate` (no `--allow-pending`) all pass in the release tree. `apt update` succeeds on an installed 4.0.0 system and offers 4.0.0-1. Every Bundles and Ember control works end to end. `make test` starts bwrap and the containment assertions pass. No polkit action grants passwordless root over an argv-taking program. No unauthenticated D-Bus method performs a root mutation.

### Phase 2 — Shared agent abstractions (3–5 weeks)

**Goals.** Create the `AgentProvider` seam and the domain schema **without changing behaviour**, and unblock the gate.

**Deliverables.** W-22 … W-32. `providers.json` + a manifest-validating gate replacing the AST freeze (keeping `REMOVED_AI_PATH`); `sf_providers.py` with `CodexCliProvider` and `OfflineMediaProvider` moved verbatim; registry dispatch replacing `getattr`; a `capability` column separating "what" from "who"; the full schema migration with `schema_version`; a validated state machine; `sf_checkpoint.py` with a structured return retiring both prose scrapers; shared secret redaction and a shared desktop library; the `sfcc` Page protocol and a real plugin contract.

**Exit criteria.** The conformance suite passes for both existing providers, and a deliberately broken fixture provider fails it. `capabilities()` output is byte-compatible with 4.0.x plus additive keys, and the UI renders unchanged. Adding a third provider requires **one** new package and **zero** edits to `sf_missions.py`, the gates or the UI — demonstrated by a no-op test provider. All three release gates pass with a provider set of size three.

### Phase 3 — Mission Control as orchestrator (4–6 weeks)

**Goals.** Make agent work observable and blockable; make approval a persisted object; replace polling with a stream.

**Deliverables.** W-33 … W-41. Hash-chained `events` mirrored to journald with `verify()`; one correlation id threaded mission → session → tool execution → Firebreak manifest; provider streams parsed into `ToolExecution` rows as they arrive with `approval_policy="never"` removed; `PolicyEngine`/`Approval` enforced in the engine so `run` refuses without a grant; `watch --json` plus inotify wake replacing both polls; per-workspace locking; an MCP audit sink and approval hook; a Fireline page in the Control Center with live sessions, Stop, Undo, the verified chain and the pending-approval queue; a provider-agnostic New Mission dialog with Grok folded in.

**Exit criteria.** For any completed mission the audit log answers: what ran, with which grants, which tools were called, which were escalated, who approved, and what changed — from one query, with a verified chain. A human can stop a running session from the GUI. A non-interactive `create`+`run` without an Approval is refused. The Missions page updates within 200 ms of a state change with the CLI idle.

### Phase 4 — Firebreak enforcement (4–6 weeks)

**Goals.** Turn the sandbox into a real boundary: no secret inside it, no ambient network, a second enforcement layer, and step-scoped specs.

**Deliverables.** W-42 … W-51. `shadowfetch-brokerd` holding every credential behind a bound unix socket, with `--codex-account` and the `sf_mission_account` import removed from Firebreak; unconditional `--unshare-net` with pasta/slirp4netns plus an authenticated CONNECT proxy enforcing a per-mission destination allowlist and writing an egress log into the manifest and receipt; `--workspace-mode`, `--mask` and step-scoped `SandboxSpec`s (net none for validation and media); a seccomp denylist, Landlock and a subuid remap; validated perimeter environment; dir-fd TOCTOU-safe path handling; checkpoint retention with a free-space precheck and dedupe; transactional `undo`; a blast-radius classifier that blocks completion until reviewed; the element moved out of the theme module.

**Exit criteria.** A test agent inside a mission cannot: read any credential file, reach any host loopback service or abstract socket, connect to a host outside the allowlist without an escalation, write outside the workspace, or leave an unreviewed host-execution hook. Every one of those attempts appears in the audit log with a decision. `receipt.json` names the credential identities, read grants, masked paths and egress destinations. A `report` mission's workspace is read-only at the OS layer.

### Phase 5 — Multi-agent workflows (4–6 weeks)

**Goals.** Prove the abstraction with real providers and remove the per-release manual tax that would otherwise scale with them.

**Deliverables.** W-52 … W-61. Claude Code, Grok and Cursor as registry providers, each passing conformance; a local-model provider reaching a broker-bound localhost socket with net none; per-workspace parallelism and per-step provider selection with cross-provider retry; the gate collapse to `tools/release/` + version TOMLs; `make vm-acceptance` with the three cheapest cases automated and self-recording; a ship-list gate; one palette source and the Ice look-and-feel fix; one version/identity source; `releases/CURRENT.json` and a declarative retirement manifest.

**Exit criteria.** The same mission runs to completion under three different providers with no code path branching on provider id outside the adapters. Cutting a release requires adding one manifest file and running one command; no test skips itself on a version change; `INSTALL-01`, `UPGRADE-01` and `RECOVERY-01` are recorded automatically.

### Phase 6 — Production hardening (ongoing, 4–8 weeks)

**Goals.** Retire the remaining duplicate systems, make every documented claim true, and put a guard on every destructive path.

**Deliverables.** W-62 … W-70. One updater (`shadowfetch-update` as a `fireproof` shim over a shared `shadowfetch.apt`); Phoenix rewritten as a transactional Python package with an intent journal, resume and loopback-btrfs tests; `shadowfetch-gpud` as a D-Bus service with a real rollback; the deploy guard extended to both Linux web properties; the artifact worker reduced to ~600 lines with split R2 bindings and stats off the request path; the metapackage describing the actual product with a duplicate-config-key gate; every honesty gap corrected (privacy claim, DeviceAllow, boot ordering, `gpgv` verification, retention wording, the dead VRAM term, local-AI residue); dead and dangerous legacy deleted; durability and hygiene fixes.

**Exit criteria.** Every root-privileged operation has its own polkit action with a validated argv grammar and a test. Every package's payload is derived, not hand-listed. No root script ships with zero tests. Every statement in a `debian/control` description, a `README`, a `.desktop` comment or a UI string is verified by a test. `apt install shadowfetch-desktop` produces the product the marketing describes.
