"""Shadowfetch first-party MCP servers (dependency-free, stdio JSON-RPC 2.0).

One file, four servers, dispatched by argv[1]:

  passport    read-only system self-check (wraps `shadowfetch-passport --json`,
              privacy-scrubbed; never uploads, never changes the system)
  phoenix     read-only list of Btrfs/snapper restore points
  checkpoint  per-workspace snapshot / diff / undo under ~/Workspaces
              (Btrfs subvolume snapshot when available, tar fallback otherwise)
  fs          scoped, read-only file access under one root (SF_MCP_FS_ROOT)

Design rules (match the rest of Shadowfetch's tooling):
  * A server that only READS says so; the one server that writes (checkpoint)
    names its writes in every tool description and touches ONLY the workspace
    it was scoped to.
  * Every tool DECLARES what it does -- READ_ONLY, MUTATING or DESTRUCTIVE --
    and the gate and the audit record read that declaration rather than the
    tool's name, so a tool added later is governed the moment it is registered.
  * Every call that CHANGES something is recorded, chained, in a log this
    package owns, or it is REFUSED. A read that cannot be recorded still
    returns unrecorded, and says on the
    server's stderr that it went unrecorded.
  * Destructive tools are not offered to agents. There is no tool-level
    approval path in this build, so `undo` -- which discards a person's work as
    readily as an agent's -- is hidden and refused unless an operator sets
    SHADOWFETCH_MCP_DESTRUCTIVE=allow AND the call carries a session id that
    names a Firebreak session record on this machine.
  * No third-party Python dependencies. Anything not in the standard library is
    an integration point that can rot or be supply-chain attacked; an MCP
    surface that an autonomous agent talks to is the last place that belongs.
  * Errors are returned as MCP tool errors (isError), never tracebacks to the
    agent.

Protocol: a minimal but correct subset of MCP over newline-delimited stdio
JSON-RPC: initialize, notifications/initialized, tools/list, tools/call, ping.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# PERMANENT INVARIANT: an executable whose output this file turns into a
# statement about the machine is named by an explicit ABSOLUTE path, never
# resolved through PATH -- and the child's PATH is pinned too, because
# resolving the program is not enough when that program resolves its own
# helpers through whatever it inherits.
#
# Two call sites in this file used shutil.which() and both were wrong in the
# same way -- the directory that was CHECKED and the directory that ANSWERED
# were not the same directory:
#
#   * `snapper` produces the restore-point listing an agent reads back. The
#     which() was constrained to a fixed TRUSTED_PATH, but the exec that
#     followed handed the bare name "snapper" to subprocess with the caller's
#     own environment, so the real PATH chose the binary that the constrained
#     lookup had approved. A `snapper` in ~/.local/bin answered a check that
#     had only ever looked at /usr/bin.
#   * the Passport is an attestation of this machine's security posture. Its
#     candidate loop tried the BARE NAME "shadowfetch-passport" BEFORE the
#     absolute path, so PATH won whenever it had an answer -- the exact
#     opposite of what the comment beside it claimed.
#
# The snapper candidate list is deliberately the same list the update
# authority uses (sfupdate.trusted.TRUSTED_PATHS): one set of places snapper
# may live, not two. It is spelled out here rather than imported because
# shadowfetch-fireline only Recommends the package that ships that module,
# and an MCP server that refused to start without it would be a worse
# failure than a listing that says it has no trusted snapper.

# Recovery is the guarantee this distribution advertises, so a checkpoint id has

# regular expression over the English sentence the MCP tool returns --
# sf_missions.py did re.search(r"checkpoint ([0-9-]+)", ...) and Firebreak split
# the same words -- which made a human sentence the recovery ABI. Reword the
# sentence, or mint an id containing anything outside [0-9-], and recovery
# breaks silently.
#
# CheckpointEngine returns dictionaries. format_*() renders the same sentences
# those callers read today FROM those dictionaries, so the words and the data

# Stage H: durability -- space, retention, integrity, and an undo that cannot
# half-happen
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The engine below used to answer "did the command exit 0?". That is a different
# question from "can this workspace be put back", and every defect Stage H fixes
# lived in the gap:
#
#   * undo DELETED the live workspace and then copied the checkpoint into the
#     hole it had just made. An ENOSPC, an EACCES on one read-only directory, or
#     a power cut anywhere in that copy left the person with neither their work
#     nor the checkpoint, and the call raised from a workspace it had already
#     destroyed. Undo now builds the tree in a SIBLING directory, verifies it,
#     and exchanges it with the workspace in one rename; the previous contents
#     are deleted only after the restored tree has been verified in place.
#   * nothing checked free space, so the first thing a full disk broke was the
#     recovery mechanism itself.
#   * nothing bounded the store. Every mission snapshot and every pre-undo
#     safety snapshot wrote a fresh full archive and kept it forever.
#   * "method": "btrfs" was recorded on the strength of an exit code from a
#     PATH-resolved `btrfs`, and a PATH-resolved `stat -f` decided whether to
#     try at all. A user-writable PATH could therefore mint a checkpoint that
#     claims to be a snapshot and restores nothing -- the same class of defect
#     as the forged journalctl. The filesystem type now comes from
#     /proc/self/mountinfo (no executable), the tool is an absolute
#     ownership-checked path, and the claim is verified against the filesystem
#     afterwards instead of believed.
#   * nothing compared the restored tree to the checkpoint, so "restored" was an
#     assertion rather than an observation. undo() now returns only after every
#     path, mode, symlink target and file digest in the workspace matches the
#     checkpoint manifest. A partial recovery raises; it is never reported as
#     success.
#
# Vocabulary used deliberately below:
#   VALIDATED  the request names a checkpoint this store holds
#   VERIFIED   a tree was compared, path by path and byte by byte, to a manifest
#   ENFORCED   the workspace cannot be left in a state that was not verified
#              (the exchange is atomic, and the failure paths delete only
