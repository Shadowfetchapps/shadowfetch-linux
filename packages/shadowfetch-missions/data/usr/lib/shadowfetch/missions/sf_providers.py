"""Shared agent abstractions: capability, provider, sandbox, invocation, events.

The one idea in this module is that a CAPABILITY is what a person wants done and
a PROVIDER is who does it. Before this existed the two were the same thing: a
mission's "kind" chose the runtime, named the method that implemented it, and
fixed the network posture, so "run this code change with a different agent" was
not expressible at all.

Nothing here knows about Codex, ffmpeg, or any other particular agent. Providers
are DATA -- a manifest under /usr/share/shadowfetch/providers -- plus an adapter
module named by that manifest. The registry never scans arbitrary Python; a
module becomes a provider only because a validated manifest named it.

Three security properties are structural rather than conventional, because
Phase 1 found real defects of each kind:

  * The registry, not the adapter, builds the SandboxSpec from the manifest.
    An adapter may NARROW what it was granted and can never widen it, so a
    provider cannot request network or credentials it did not declare.

  * An Invocation carries credential IDENTITIES, never credential VALUES. The
    value is injected at the Firebreak boundary by code that never came from a
    provider. HOW it is injected is a separate question with its own answer:
    see CREDENTIAL_DELIVERY_CLAIMS, which says what each delivery mode does and
    does not buy, and credential_delivery(), which reports what a given manifest
    actually gets. Today every shipped manifest gets "environment", which means
    the value is readable inside the sandbox.

  * An Invocation's executable is CLASSIFIED by who can modify it, and the
    class must be one its manifest declared. An adapter may look its program
    up however it likes; classify_executable() re-checks the answer against
    the ownership and mode of the file and of every directory above it, so a
    program anyone else could substitute cannot be executed.
