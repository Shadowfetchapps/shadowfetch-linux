        out its 10 s budget behind a worker commit stalled on a slow disk and
        answered "busy" -- the stop simply did not happen. Now, if the lock does
        not come inside CANCEL_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS (or the client gives up and
        kills the command), the request survives, the answer says it was saved,
        and the worker records and honours it as soon as it can.

        With the request saved, this write also commits WITHOUT an fsync
        (synchronous=NORMAL). The lock limit bounds only the WAIT: with the lock
        free, the commit's WAL sync plus the directory sync every new connection
        makes on its first sync still ran -- 8.1 s on a disk delayed 4 s per
        sync, while the 5.0.0 guest's syncs took 15-34 s, so Stop outlived the
        desktop's 30 s limit in exactly the condition the saved request was for.
        In WAL mode NORMAL stays consistent after a crash, and the commit is
        durable at the next synced commit or checkpoint. Until then the saved
        request is KEPT (apply_cancel_requests() removes it after syncing the
        WAL), so a crash loses the stop only by losing both the commit and the
        request -- the window a saved request already had on its own.
        Residual, measured: when a checkpoint has just emptied the WAL, the next
        write restarts it and SQLite syncs the new WAL header even under NORMAL
        (two syncs). OFF would skip that and is not crash-safe there.

        If the request cannot be saved (a full disk, a read-only state
        directory) this is the 5.0.0 cancel: the whole budget, a synced commit,
