"""Phase 2.5: a declared-vs-effective audit of every SandboxSpec field.

Phase 2 found that `cpu_seconds` was declared in a manifest, bounded by the
schema, refused-on-widening by `narrow()` AND by `verify_invocation()` -- and
then never reached Firebreak, so a provider declaring 60 seconds silently got
the mission's 900-second default while four separate layers made the
declaration look enforced. The fix was one line in `run_process()`. The
question this file answers is: which OTHER fields are in that state?

The answer is a TABLE, not prose, because prose rots silently. `AUDIT` below
records, for every field of `SandboxSpec`, the truth at five stages:

    DECLARED   a manifest can express it                (provider-manifest.schema.json)
    VALIDATED  it is checked when the manifest loads     (sf_jsonschema / load_manifest)
    NARROWED   it is refused on widening                 (narrow / verify_invocation)
    PASSED     the value reaches the Firebreak argv      (run_process)
    ENFORCED   Firebreak acts on it                      (bwrap / rlimit / cgroup)

and every test in this file asserts one column of that table against reality.
A field marked PASSED must genuinely appear in the constructed Firebreak
command line; a field marked NOT PASSED must genuinely not. A field marked
ENFORCED is, wherever the machine allows it, demonstrated by running a real
sandboxed process that tries to exceed the limit and observing the refusal --
`evidence` says "executed" for those and "source" where only reading proves it.

Appearing in argv is NOT enforcement and is never counted as such here: each
"executed" enforcement claim below is a process that was actually stopped.
