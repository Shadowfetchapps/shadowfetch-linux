"""The Page protocol and the one section registry (W-31).

What W-31 (ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md:849) asks for:

    `sfcc` Page protocol + single registry; context-object constructors;
    `badge_count`/`blocking_reason`; rename `AgentsPage`

What it was before this module.  app.py held the registry as TWO lists --
`SECTIONS` (key, title, subtitle) and a `self.pages` list literal -- joined by
nothing but list index, plus a third structure, `ALIASES`, whose values had to
name a key in the first.  A page added to one and not the other silently showed
the wrong screen, and a key removed from `SECTIONS` turned two `next(...)`
lookups into an uncaught StopIteration.  Nothing in the program checked; the
pairing was pinned in a test file instead, which is a record of the coupling,
not a removal of it.

Now: ONE tuple, `REGISTRY`.  A section is a `Section` and carries its own key,
title, subtitle, aliases and the callable that builds its widget.  There is no
index arithmetic between two lists because there is only one list, and the
alias map and the badge lookup are derived from it rather than restated.

Three things a section may declare, all optional, all with honest defaults:

    build(context)     construct the widget.  The knowledge of what a page
                       needs (sensors, a router, both, neither) lives WITH the
                       page, as a classmethod, not in the shell.  That is the
                       "context-object constructor" this finding asks for: the
                       shell passes one PageContext and knows nothing else.
    badge_count()      the number on the sidebar, or None.  app.py used to
                       hard-code `if key == "software"`; now the page that has
                       a badge is the page that answers.
    blocking_reason()  a sentence explaining why the window must not close
                       right now, or None.  app.py used to test one duck-typed
                       attribute name (`review_pending`) and then supply the
                       sentence itself, so a second page with a reason to
                       block had no way to say so and no way to say why.

This module deliberately imports no page module at import time.  Sections name
their module and class as strings, resolved when the section is built.  Be
precise about what that buys: the REGISTRY can be read, and its aliases and row
lookups exercised, without constructing a single Qt widget -- which is what
lets the tests above check the routing table cheaply.  It is NOT containment.
A first-party page that raises still takes the window down with it, because a
shipped page failing to construct is a bug, and an error card in its place
would hide it.  Containment is for code this package does not own: see
sfcc.plugins.
