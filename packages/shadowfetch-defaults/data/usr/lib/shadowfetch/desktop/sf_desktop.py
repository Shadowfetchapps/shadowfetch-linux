"""The shared desktop library: one implementation of every desktop FACT.

W-30 (ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md:848) asks for a shared desktop library carrying
`catalog`, `hwscan`, `net`, `launch` and `bundle_install_argv`, imported by
both `sfcc` and Welcome, because those five were implemented twice in two
divergent shapes.  This module is that library, and it is now the only copy:

    /usr/lib/shadowfetch/desktop/sf_desktop.py   shipped by shadowfetch-defaults
    sfcc/desktop.py                              loads it and IS it (sys.modules)
    /usr/bin/shadowfetch-welcome                 loads it as `desktop`

Why shadowfetch-defaults owns it.  shadowfetch-control-center already
Recommends shadowfetch-welcome, so a library owned by the Control Center and
imported by Welcome inverts the pillar order -- the first-boot wizard would
reach up into the whole desktop.  shadowfetch-defaults sits under both.
Welcome did not name shadowfetch-defaults at all before this change; it does
now, and the Depends cycle that creates with defaults' own Depends on Welcome
is written down in both debian/control files rather than discovered later.

`net` is the one member of the W-30 list that is deliberately NOT here.  The
Control Center talks to NetworkManager through dbus-python and Welcome talks
to it through Qt DBus; sharing that means one of the two changing its D-Bus
stack, which is a larger change than this one.  Recorded as not_representable
here, not quietly dropped.

Four properties this module has that the two copies it replaces did not:

1.  It imports no Qt.  A fact about the machine is not a widget, Welcome does
    not use PyQt in the same way, and a helper that cannot be imported without
    a display server cannot be shared, tested cheaply, or reused by a CLI.

2.  Every program it executes is named by an explicit absolute path from
    PROGRAMS below, resolved through `trusted_program()`, which walks a fixed
    tuple of system directories with os.access -- not shutil.which, and never
    the caller's PATH.  The permanent invariant is that an executable whose
    output establishes or attests a security fact is invoked through a trusted
    absolute path with a defined trust classification.  This mattered here:
    `system_summary()` printed "System check passed" from a bare `systemctl`
    argv, and `installed_map()` decided which packages a person is told they
    already have from a bare `dpkg-query` argv.  Both inherit the session's
    PATH, and both feed a sentence the reader takes as a statement of fact.

3.  A catalog file may hold one record or a JSON array of them.  Welcome's
    copy accepted only the single-record form, so the two front-ends could
    read the same directory and disagree about what was in it.

4.  The privileged install argv is built in ONE place.  Welcome's copy spelled
    it `["pkexec", BUNDLE_HELPER, "install", id]` -- pkexec as a bare name
    that the session's $PATH resolves.  That is the invariant above, not a
    style difference: a same-user process that can prepend a directory to PATH
    becomes the program the person types their administrator password into, or
    swallows the install and reports success.  The Control Center already
    named pkexec absolutely and Welcome did not, which is exactly the kind of
    divergence W-30 exists to end.
