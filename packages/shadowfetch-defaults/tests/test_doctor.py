"""shadowfetch-doctor: the properties that make it safe to run and to send.

Four things are being pinned here, and each one is a defect that has actually
shipped somewhere before:

  1. A SUPPORT BUNDLE NEVER CONTAINS A CREDENTIAL. The headline test plants
     real-shaped secrets in paths the bundle DOES collect from and asserts
     none of them survives into the archive, and plants more in paths a home
     directory holds (ssh keys, shell history, browser profile) and asserts
     the tool refuses to read those at all. The two are separate controls --
     redaction and the allowlist -- and both have to hold on their own.
  2. NO PATH LOOKUP DECIDES A SECURITY FACT. journalctl or systemctl resolved
     through a user-writable PATH can forge a clean answer. Every executable
     comes from the TRUSTED_TOOLS table by absolute path.
  3. "NOT INSPECTED" IS NOT "PASS". A diagnostic that prints a tick when it
     could not look converts ignorance into assurance.
  4. THERE IS ONE REDACTOR. If sf_redact cannot be loaded, --support refuses;
     it does not fall back to a weaker local copy that would drift.
