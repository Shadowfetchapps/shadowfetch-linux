"""The shared desktop library this package ships, and the gate that keeps it
single (W-30, second half).

W-30 asks for one desktop library -- catalog, hwscan, net, launch,
bundle_install_argv -- imported by BOTH the Control Center and Welcome.  Stage
P landed the Control Center half as sfcc/desktop.py and said so plainly: there
was one implementation inside the Control Center and a second one still inside
Welcome, and tools/drift_gate.py reported the pair BLOCKED.

This half moved that module to shadowfetch-defaults, which both front-ends now
depend on, and pointed Welcome at it.  The Control Center's own suite
(packages/shadowfetch-control-center/tests/test_desktop_library.py) still
covers the library's behaviour, because sfcc.desktop IS the library object; the
tests here cover the things that suite structurally cannot:

  * that the library is SHIPPED, and that both front-ends can reach it on an
    installed system rather than only in this tree -- a shared module nobody
    packages is two ImportErrors and a green test run;
  * that Welcome really stopped implementing its own copies, including the
    privileged argv where its copy named pkexec by a bare word the session's
    PATH resolved;
  * that the rewritten drift-gate check FAILS on the ways the duplication has
    actually been made to come back -- including every one an adversarial
    verifier used, which the first version of this check reported clean.  A
    gate is worth landing only if it has been seen to go red on the thing it
    claims to catch.

The claim over these tests is DETECTED, not ENFORCED.  The check is a CI-time
scanner over source shape; it prevents nothing at runtime, and WhatThisBarrierStillMisses
records the honest edge of it, measured rather than guessed.  The enforced half is inside the
library -- every program it runs is resolved from PROGRAMS -- and it only
covers a front-end that CALLS the library, which is exactly what these tests
and that check are here to detect the loss of.

    Row 1 of this stage's report said the drift gate ENFORCED "one

    statement.  It never asked whether a front-end has a SECOND
    implementation, and three evasions composed to walk the whole plant past
    it:

      1.  the readers were held by grepping for `def load_catalog(` and

      2.  the five reserved paths were checked with `path in code`, so

    Welcome's `_load_desktop()` had the same defect the Control Center's did:
    it checked that the file exists, put its directory on sys.path, and then
    resolved the module BY NAME -- and `import` consults sys.modules before
    sys.path, so the existence check it had just performed decided nothing. A
    planted module was accepted with PKEXEC back to the bare word and the
    install argv resolved through $PATH again.

    This class used to apply the reported remedy to a COPY and run it, because
    Welcome belonged to another package: a remedy nobody has run is a guess.
    The remedy was applied to the real front-end, so the copy is gone and these
    run against the shipped file. What they assert is unchanged -- the loader
    refuses a poisoned sys.modules and still loads the real library -- and it
    is now a statement about what ships rather than about what would happen if
    somebody applied a patch.
