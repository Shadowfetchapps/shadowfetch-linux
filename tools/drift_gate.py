"""Stage X drift gate: fail when a copy diverges from its single source.

Why this exists
---------------
ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md:19 names duplication "the dominant maintenance cost and
the direct cause of shipped defects", and ADR-0009 (ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
:157) requires one authority per fact.  Six facts are restated across this
tree today: the theme palette, the release version, the signing fingerprint,
the current-release pointer, the workspace-name rule and the shared desktop
helper argv.

Deduplication that is not GATED comes back.  This file is the gate.  The
authorities it compares against are:

    tools/release/versions/<v>.toml  version, codename, signing fingerprint
                                     (Stage Q's release data -- this gate reads
                                     it rather than keeping a second copy)
    tools/truth/palette.json         theme palette (3 named surfaces)
    tools/truth/release.json         release-pointer contract, canonical URLs
    WORKSPACE_NAME_RULE (below)      the workspace-name rule, as a corpus

Two finding kinds, and they are NOT the same thing
--------------------------------------------------
    DRIFT    a copy disagrees with its source.  Always exit non-zero.
    BLOCKED  the duplication is real and detected, but removing it needs a
             change outside this stage's file territory.  Printed on every
             run so it cannot be forgotten; exits non-zero only under
             --strict, so it does not red the release gate for work another
             agent owns.

A BLOCKED finding is NOT an enforced control.  It is an OBSERVATION with a
named remedy.  Do not read this file's exit code as "the tree is deduplicated"
-- read the printed report.

    file -- a front-end assembling a privileged argv at all, a function that
    reads the catalog directory whatever it is called, the library losing one
    of the facts it was created to hold, or the packaging silently making
    "both import one module" untrue on an installed system while it stays true
    in this tree.

    DETECTED, not ENFORCED.  The two words are not interchangeable here
    (docs/PRIVILEGED_OPERATIONS.md: ENFORCED means the enforcement layer
    prevents the behaviour AND an adversarial test proves it).  This is a
    CI-time scanner over source SHAPE: it reads what the tree says, it stops no
    process from doing anything, and a spelling it cannot fold is a spelling it
    cannot see -- a program name reached through a dict subscript, a path built
    with chr(), a privileged helper under a name prefix nobody added to
    PRIVILEGED_PREFIXES.  Those three were planted and MISSED, deliberately
    measured rather than guessed.

    The row this check first shipped under said ENFORCED over "one
    implementation of catalog/hwscan/launch/installed-map/privileged argv".
    The barrier underneath was `path in code` plus a grep for
    `def load_catalog(`, and an adversarial verifier walked a complete second
    catalog reader and a complete second bundle installer past it on the first
    attempt, with every test green.  The word was wrong before the code was.

    What IS enforced on this seam is smaller and lives in the library:
    sf_desktop.py resolves every program it runs from PROGRAMS, so a front-end
    that CALLS the library cannot be handed a $PATH-resolved binary.  What this
    check adds is DETECTION of a front-end that stops calling it.
