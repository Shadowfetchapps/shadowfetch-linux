# Cross-checked against the release data's DERIVED binary version by
# tools/tests/test_drkonqi_pickup_contract.py, and kept honest by
# VERSION_SITES in tools/drift_gate.py -- which also means the stamper
# rewrites it. It is a literal rather than an import because gate.py
# imports this module, so reaching back into gate from here would be a
# cycle. Two independently-maintained copies that a gate compares is the
# point; two that nothing compares is how this one reached 4.1.0 saying
# 4.0.0-1.
VERSION = "5.0.1-1"
# The Debian drkonqi the image installs (package list pins it to this exact
# version). 5.0.0 moved from 6.6.5-3 to 6.7.4-1 with the 20260929 snapshot.
# The helper still compiles the vendored 6.6.5 source: checked 2026-09-29, the
# seven files it builds (src/coredump/{coredump,coredumpwatcher}.{cpp,h},
# memory.h, socket.h, processor/main.cpp), the pickup and processor@ unit
# templates and the launcher socket are byte-identical in the KDE-signed
# drkonqi-6.7.4 tarball, and Debian 6.7.4-1 installs units with the SAME
# hashes as below. Upstream has not fixed the pickup hang, so the patch is
# still needed. Re-run that comparison before moving this again.
