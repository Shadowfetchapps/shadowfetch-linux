"""Phase 3 attacks 12-18: a mission's lifecycle under interruption.

Seven attacks, each against a THROWAWAY store, run as a module the lead can
compose:

    12  malformed-tool-events            provider output carrying broken tool events
    13  duplicate-tool-events            the same tool event twice
    14  kill-mission-control             SIGKILL the orchestrator mid-execution
    15  kill-provider-mid-session        SIGKILL the provider process mid-session
    16  cancel-completion-race           Stop pressed as execution finishes
    17  worker-restart-stale-running     a worker starts on a RUNNING row nobody owns
    18  mcp-destructive-no-correlation   checkpoint.undo without a correlated session

14, 15 and 17 use real sandboxed processes and real signals: a mocked exception
proves the orchestrator's own except clause runs, which is not the question.
The question is what happens to somebody else's process, so the fixture is a
genuine ffmpeg encode that takes long enough to be interrupted in the middle.

VERDICTS.  PASS means the system refused the action or contained it -- and that
it CHANGED NOTHING it should not have, which is checked by reading rows back,
counting events and verifying the hash chain, not by observing that something
raised.  An action the system cannot prevent is recorded as a finding with
"the action itself was not prevented" said in those words.

WHAT THIS TOUCHES.  Every attack builds its own tempfile.mkdtemp() world and
points SHADOWFETCH_AGENT_WORKSPACES / _MISSIONS_STATE / _FIREBREAK_STATE /
_MCP_STATE at it, so the operator's ~/.local/state is never written.  Two
things do reach outside that world, because the engine works that way and
suppressing them would be measuring a different program:
  * Store.mirror() sends each event head to /dev/log, so the run leaves
    `shadowfetch-audit` lines in the system journal under throwaway chain ids.
  * Firebreak starts a transient systemd --user scope per sandboxed process.
Both are cleaned up by the kernel or by systemd --collect; the module also
kills anything still holding the lab root open before it deletes it.

TWO TRAPS THIS FILE WORKS AROUND, both of which silently test the WRONG code:
  * PATH: `shadowfetch-firebreak` resolves through PATH, so the source-tree
    bin directory is prepended for every child.  Without it the installed
    3.0.0 Firebreak answers and rejects 4.0.0's flags.
  * The source-tree `shadowfetch-mcp` wrapper prefers
    /usr/lib/shadowfetch/mcp/sf_mcp.py when that file exists, so on a host with
    fireline 3.0.0 installed it drives the 3.0.0 engine.  Attack 18 therefore
    executes the 4.0.0 implementation file directly.

Standalone:  python3 tools/attacks/attack_lifecycle.py [attack-name ...]
Exit status is non-zero if any attack FAILED (a SKIPPED attack does not fail
the run; a harness error does, and says so in its first words).
