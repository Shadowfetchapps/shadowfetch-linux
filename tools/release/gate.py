"""Shared foundation for the Shadowfetch Linux release gates.

STAGE Q -- why this module exists.

The release gates were version-copied families. tools/ held six copies each of
source_gate, package_gate, iso_gate and verify_acceptance and five of
build_release_evidence: 29 modules, 15,265 lines, of which only ~3,000 were the
live 4.0.0 copies. Cutting a release meant copying a module and editing the
version strings inside it, which produced two defects that were both real:

  1. The unit tests were left pointing at the OLD copies. tools/tests held the
     only ISO-gate tests against iso_gate_2_1_5.py, so every line of gate logic
     that actually ran for 4.0.0 -- critical_payload_parity_gate, drkonqi_gate,
     the diverged payload_gate and main -- had no test at all.
  2. Fixes landed in one copy. The Git-unavailable handling, the evidence
     entropy floor and the waiver contract exist only in the 4.0.0 copies; the
     2.1.x copies still carry the bugs they were written with.

There is now ONE implementation per gate family. Everything that changes purely
because the version number changed lives in versions/<version>.toml. Cutting a
release needs that one data file. Anything that changes because the PRODUCT
changed -- a new package, a new payload path -- is an edit to the single live
module, which is a content change and not duplication.

The historical modules were deleted rather than archived. They are recoverable
from Git (tags v2.1.5, v3.0.0, v3.5.0, v4.0.0), which is a stronger
reproducibility record than a copy in the working tree because it also carries
the tree the gate ran against. Running today's implementation against an old
version's data file is NOT the gate that shipped that release, and this module
never claims it is: see ReleaseData.historical.

PERMANENT INVARIANT -- trusted program resolution.

Any executable whose output establishes, verifies, enforces or attests a
security fact must be invoked through an explicit trusted ABSOLUTE path and
must carry a defined trust classification. No PATH lookup, anywhere.

The defect this closes was live in this tree. source_gate_4_0_0.py located
gitleaks with a PATH lookup and then ran it by bare name, and on the build host
PATH resolves gitleaks to /home/<builder>/.local/bin/gitleaks -- a directory the
builder can write. The secret scan is the only control that
decides "no credential shipped in this release"; anything able to drop a file
in that directory could make it pass unconditionally. shellcheck had the same
exposure. Both are now resolved through this module.
