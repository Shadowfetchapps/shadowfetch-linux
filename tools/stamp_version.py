"""Rewrite every anchored copy of the release version -- all of them, or none.

WHAT THIS GUARANTEES, EXACTLY
-----------------------------
Not atomicity across files.  POSIX has no multi-file commit and this tool does
not pretend to one.  What it does guarantee, in decreasing strength:

  * Nothing is written until EVERY new file body has been computed and EVERY
    anchor has been confirmed to match exactly once, and a second pass has
    confirmed that the gate's own pattern now reads the new version out of the
    computed body.  A moved anchor, a missing file, a file that is not UTF-8,
    a pattern that matches twice -- every one of those is found in the compute
    phase, and the tree is left UNCHANGED.
  * Each file is replaced through a temporary in the same directory: written,
    fsynced, chmod'ed back to the original mode, os.replace()d, and the
    directory fsynced afterwards.  A reader sees the whole old file or the
    whole new one.  A crash cannot leave the truncated half-file that
    write_text() can.
  * If a replace fails partway through the sequence, the files already replaced
    are restored from the bodies captured in the compute phase, through that
    same temporary-and-rename path.  (ADR-0009 asks for precisely this:
    "validate all, then write, with a restore-on-failure backup".)  If the
    restore ITSELF fails, the error names every file left at the new version
    rather than swallowing it.

  * What is left, and cannot be removed at this layer: a SIGKILL or a power cut
    BETWEEN two os.replace() calls leaves some files stamped and some not.
    Nothing short of a filesystem transaction prevents that.  `git diff` and
    tools/drift_gate.py both show it.

The defect this shape replaces.  stamp() was nine sequential write_text()
calls.  Injecting a failure at write #5 of 9 left six of the gate's twelve
version sites reading 4.1.0 and six reading 4.0.0 -- a tree in a state no
release was ever in, with no backup and no revert.  Every injection point is
pinned now by tools/tests/test_stamp_version.py.

WHICH SITES
-----------
The list is tools/drift_gate.py's VERSION_SITES, IMPORTED rather than retyped.
The gate is what decides whether a stamp was complete, so a stamper carrying
its own copy of the list is a second authority that can only drift from the
first -- and it did: the previous stamper wrote nine of the gate's twelve
sites and left the grok-bot --version string, the drkonqi-pickup CMake project
version and the README fact table at the old version, which is exactly the
drift the gate then reported.  check_version's own remedy text admitted it
("the Makefile, README, the CMake project version and the acceptance manifest
are hand-maintained").

Plus one site the gate checks in check_release_data instead: the Makefile's
`VERSION ?=`.  It is the same fact and it is stampable, so it is stamped.

Anchor-driven, never search-and-replace.  The old version string legitimately
survives a bump in several of these files: shadowfetch-grok-bot carries
VERSION = "0.43.0" (upstream Grok Bot's version, not ours), and sf_missions.py
says "4.0.0" twelve times in comments describing the on-disk format 4.0.0
wrote -- those must keep saying 4.0.0.  Only the byte range captured by the
gate's own group(1) is replaced.

REMOVED, and why.  The previous stamper also rewrote LICENSES.md and
SOURCES.md through `(Shadowfetch Linux\\s+)[0-9.]+`.  Neither file has carried
a version since its heading became "# Shadowfetch Linux - Licensing", so that
re.sub() matched nothing and rewrote each file with its own bytes; re.sub
reports no error for zero matches, so two of the nine writes were silent
no-ops and the tool still printed success.  They are not version sites.  If one
gains a version string it belongs in the gate's VERSION_SITES first, and this
tool will pick it up from there.

SITES THIS TOOL MUST NOT WRITE
------------------------------
Two of the facts the gate compares are not this tool's to invent, so it
verifies them, names them, and exits non-zero rather than reporting a success
it cannot support:

  * qa/<version>/acceptance.json -- the acceptance manifest.  It records
    MEASURED facts (iso_sha256, iso_size_bytes, source_commit, per-case
    evidence hashes).  A stamper that created one, or that rewrote an older
    release's manifest to name the new version, would be attaching the
    previous ISO's measurements to this release.  It is produced by the
    acceptance run.
  * tools/release/versions/<version>.toml -- the release data the gate reads as
    the authority for what the version IS.  It carries the edition, subtitle,
    codename, package lists and the signing fingerprint: release decisions, not
    a version string.  Until it names the stamped version, drift_gate compares
    every site against the older release and reports drift at all of them.

Exit codes: 0 every site (including those two) agrees with the stamped version;
1 the anchored sites were stamped but the sites above still disagree, each one
named; 2 refused, nothing written.  --outstanding-ok turns 1 into 0 for a
caller that legitimately runs before the acceptance run exists (`make packages`
depends on stamp-version); it prints the same report either way.
